                <h1>What is Zen?</h1>
                <p>
                    Zen is something we are, our true nature expressing itself
                    moment by moment. Zen is also something we do, a disciplined
                    practice through which we can realize the joy of being.
                </p>
                <h2>What is the practice of Zen? </h2>
                <p>
                    Zen is a path that must be studied, practiced, and
                    actualized. The core of Zen is zazen, which requires
                    motivation, patience, discipline, and dedication, and is
                    cultivated through repeated, consistent practice.
                </p>
                <h2>What is a Zen State of Mind? </h2>
                <p>
                    Formal Zen practice begins with two basic activities: we
                    sit, and we breathe, with awareness. From that basic
                    engagement, we extend the activity to include walking,
                    chanting, eating, working and to every aspect of daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>How do I find my Zen?</h2>
                <p>
                    First, breathe in with full awareness. Appreciate it fully.
                    Then breathe out, slowly, with equal appreciation. Hold onto
                    nothing, give it all away. Breathe in with gratitude;
                    breathe out with love. Receiving and offering is what we are
                    doing each time we inhale and exhale. To do so with
                    conscious awareness, on a regular basis, is the
                    transformative practice we call Zen Meditaion.
                </p>
                <h3>What Zen is Not</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many common misconceptions about Zen. Zen practice
                    is not religion, is not a belief system, is not a dogma or
                    doctrine. One does not have to be buddist to achieve a zen
                    state of mind.
